# Iterators Library

This library provides assorted iterators, including wrappers for input and output streams.

Interface documentation can be directly found in the library header file, [libraries/iterators.hpp](../libraries/iterators.hpp), in Javadoc-esque documentation comments.

## Quick Start

*   Building requires [SCons 2](http://scons.org/) and [buildtools](https://github.com/gcrossland/buildtools). Ensure that the contents of buildtools is available on PYTHONPATH e.g. `export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/buildtools` (or is in the SCons site_scons dir).
*   The library depends on [Core](https://github.com/gcrossland/Core). Build this first.
*   From the working directory (or archive) root, run SCons to make a release build, specifying the compiler to use and where to find it e.g. `scons CONFIG=release TOOL_GCC=/usr/bin`.
    *   The library files are deployed to the library cache dir, which is (by default) under buildtools.
*   Run the tests by running the executable produced by the build and checking that it completes successfully e.g. `./iterators || echo "tests failed"`.
    *   If a test fails, the test executable will abort. To get more information (particularly a stack trace), run a debug build with a debugger.
